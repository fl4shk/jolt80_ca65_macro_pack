# SPCPU ca65 Macro Pack
This is macro pack for assembling Small Practice CPU code with ca65.

ca65 Documentation:  http://cc65.github.io/doc/ca65.html

This is what I've been using to write test code for Small Practice CPU.


## How to use this macro pack:
1.  Include "include/spcpu\_ca65\_macro\_pack.spinc"
2.  Optionally use the existing "makefile" and "ldconfig.cfg"
3.  Optionally look at the files in src/ for some examples
